{"name":"LocomotiveCMS on Heroku","tagline":"LaunchPad Lab has created a simple Heroku integration to host the powerful Rails-based CMS: Locomotive","body":"### Content Management Systems\r\nThere are countless Content Management Systems to choose from, but many of them lack key features that can constrain your website and perhaps even your business over time. \r\nWe've found that LocomotiveCMS is a powerful CMS designed to save time and help you focus on what matters: front-end technology, standard development process and no learning time for you and your business.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Setup Process\r\nWe've used this powerful CMS platform a number of times and have come up with a good process and fast process for getting up and running fast.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging our preferred hosting platform, Heroku, we've created a 1-click install button to setup LocomotiveCMS for you.\r\n\r\n![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)\r\n\r\n### Deployment\r\n\r\nThere are 2 configurations we will use for [Locomotive CMS](http://locomotivecms.com/). Select either `single-site` or `multi-site` to use the deploy to `Heroku` button.\r\n\r\n- [Single site](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/heroku_locomotive_engine/tree/single_site)\r\n- [Multi-site](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/heroku_locomotive_engine/tree/multi_site)\r\n\r\nEach of these allow us to quickly deploy a cloud-hosted CMS for a client. Once deployed, we can develop custom templates and content for each client.\r\n\r\n### About Us\r\n\r\nLaunchPad Lab is a full-service web design and development studio that focuses on growing our clientsâ€™ businesses.
