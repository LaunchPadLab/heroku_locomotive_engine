#LocomotiveCMS

##Deployment

There are 2 configurations we will use for [Locomotive CMS](http://locomotivecms.com/). Select either `single-site` or `multi-site` to use the deploy to `Heroku` button.

- [Single site](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/heroku_locomotive_engine/tree/single_site)
- [Multi-site](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/heroku_locomotive_engine/tree/multi_site)

Each of these allow us to quickly deploy a cloud-hosted CMS for a client. Once deployed, we can develop custom templates and content for each client.
