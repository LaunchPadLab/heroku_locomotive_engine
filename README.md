#LocomotiveCMS

LocomotiveCMS is a powerful CMS designed to save time and help you focus on what matters: front-end technology, standard development process and no learning time for your client.

We've used this powerful platform a number of times and have come up with a good process for getting up and running fast. Follow the instructions below.

##Deployment

There are 2 configurations we will use for [Locomotive CMS](http://locomotivecms.com/). Select either `single-site` or `multi-site` to use the deploy to `Heroku` button.

- [Single site](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/heroku_locomotive_engine/tree/single_site)
- [Multi-site](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/heroku_locomotive_engine/tree/multi_site)

Each of these allow us to quickly deploy a cloud-hosted CMS for a client. Once deployed, we can develop custom templates and content for each client.
